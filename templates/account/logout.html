{#
  File: templates/account/logout.html
  Purpose: Confirm sign out before ending the session.
  Context: With django-allauth, GET /accounts/logout/ renders this page only.
           The user is not logged out until a POST is submitted to the same URL.
  UX: Shows a clear confirmation, primary action to sign out, and a safe cancel route.
  Dev notes:
    - While this page is shown, request.user is still authenticated,
      so your nav will display the signed-in links.
    - After submitting the form (POST), allauth logs the user out and redirects.
    - If you want one-click logout later, set ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_ON_GET = True in settings.
